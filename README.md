1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   A: Chat Away, a social media company, already has a very successful website and now wants to develop a mobile application for their service. They would like
   to do this while outsourcing the project and staying within a set budget.
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   A: As silly as it sounds, I think the best thing I did was being able to stay professional and gramatically correct throughout the document, all while listing
   each issue, request, etc. in a clean manner.
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   A: I found that being able to have prompts ready really helped me in preparing what to look for in the requests scoping out as much as possible to be fully
   prepared for the actual development of the application.
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   A: I feel like I could have been better prepared when it came to the domain model and explaining it better with a better put together UML diagram. Along with that,
   while not directly related to the project itself, I really do feel that I could have been better about putting more time towards working on the document and class
   itself.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   A: I made sure that I covered every single request and need to cover each and every one of them specifically. Making sure to cover all of the needs of the user is
   because they are that, the USER of the application you are developing. If you are able to satisfy most of the needs a user is looking for, the application will be
   a success.
6. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   A: As I previously mentioned, I think dedicating more time to the actual design and development of the software would habe been key. This would have allowed me to
   get more information on each issue/request that the company had, allowing me to obtain a better idea of what to implement into the design. In the future, I will
   ensure to dedicate more time to the design part of the project.
